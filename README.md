# neuroLSD
This repository contains scripts and evaluation pipelines related to the **neuroLSD** project.

The **neuroLSD** project investigates how lysosomal storage disorderâ€“associated pathways contribute to neurodegeneration using **stem-cellâ€“derived neuronal models**. We integrate **quantitative proteomics**, **lipidomics**, and **calcium imaging** to profile functional and molecular changes in cortical-like iNeurons (iN) and dopaminergic-like iDA neurons.

Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSDs) comprise a broad group of diseases affecting lysosomal degradation, ion flux, and lipid catabolism. Within this group, sphingolipidoses genes such as GBA1, SMPD1, and ASAH1 are known or candidate risk factors for Parkinsonâ€™s Disease, though the mechanisms remain unclear. Building on prior work in HeLa cells, we generated a human embryonic stem cell library with 23 LSD gene knockouts and differentiated them into cortical and dopaminergic neurons.  

Our proteomic and functional analyses reveal lineage-specific alterations in organellar proteomes, uncovering diverse neuronal vulnerabilities. Notably, GBA1-/- and ASAH1-/- dopaminergic neurons show disruptions in synaptic and mitochondrial compartments, correlating with impaired neuronal firing and presynaptic protein localization.  

This LSD mutant toolkit and associated proteomic landscape provide a resource for decoding how lysosomal dysfunction impacts neuronal health and for exploring mechanistic links between lysosomal storage disorders and Parkinsonâ€™s Disease.

ðŸš§ work in progress ðŸš§

## ðŸ”¬ Imaging
Analysis workflows for calcium imaging and TH-positive neuron quantification.  
- **Calcium:** Segmentation of neuronal soma in calcium imaging using Cellpose-SAM custom models, followed by R pipelines for Î”F/F extraction, trace binarization, network analysis, and multi-dataset integration.
- **TH:** Automated quantification of TH-positive neurons in iN/iDA cultures via Python-based segmentation and R statistical analysis.
- **Models:** Custom Cellpose SAM models for neuronal soma live in imaging/models, with MODEL_INDEX.txt linking to Zenodo downloads.
- **Endoâ€‘lyso HeLa:** Endoâ€‘lysosomal confocal analysis for HeLa in imaging/endolyso, including channel splitting, Cellpose SAM based segmentation, EEA1 and TFN colocalization metrics, and an Rmd that outputs figures and annotated CSVs.

See [`imagingREADME.md`](imaging/imagingREADME.md) for details on workflow steps, input formats, and outputs.



## ðŸ§¬ Lipidomics
Lipidomic profiling of HeLa and dayâ€‘21 iNeurons (Ctrl vs ASAH1â€‘/â€‘) across wholeâ€‘cell and organelleâ€‘IP fractions, with outputs including classâ€‘level barplots, volcano plots, and perâ€‘lipid log2FC tables.



## ðŸ§ª proteomics
Contains Rmd scipts for evaluation of stem-cell derived cortical-like iNeurons and stem-cell derived dopamenergic-like iDA neurons at day 50 of in-vitro differentiation.

- `diff118_iNiDA_d23.Rmd`: TMTpro-based proteomic analysis of day 23 iN and iDA cells across Control and ASAH1-/- conditions.
- `diff132_d50_nDIA.Rmd`: nDIA proteomics of whole-cell iNeurons and iDA neurons at day 50, including organelle-level annotation and HeLa cross-comparison.
- `diff136_iNd35_ctrl_asah1e1_axonalproteome.Rmd`: TMTpro analysis of whole-cell, soma, and axonal fractions in iNeurons with axonal enrichment and RoR modeling.
- `HeLa_Ctrl-ASAH1_LysoIP.Rmd`: Proteomic analysis of isolated lysosomes from HeLa cells comparing control and ASAH1-/- lines, with detailed lysosomal and autophagy annotation.
