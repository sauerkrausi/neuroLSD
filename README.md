# neuroLSD
This repository contains scripts and evaluation-pipelines related to the **neuroLSD** project.

The **neuroLSD** project investigates how lysosomal storage disorderâ€“associated pathways contribute to neurodegeneration using **stem-cellâ€“derived neuronal models**. We integrate **quantitative proteomics** and **calcium imaging** to profile functional and molecular changes in cortical-like iNeurons (iN) and dopaminergic-like iDA neurons.

ðŸš§ work in progress ðŸš§

## ðŸ”¬ Imaging
Analysis workflows for calcium imaging and TH-positive neuron quantification.  
- **Calcium**: Cellpose-SAMâ€“based segmentation (Python) and R Markdown pipelines for Î”F/F signal extraction, trace binarization, and network-level analysis, including a master pipeline for multi-dataset integration.  
- **TH**: R and Python scripts for quantifying TH-positive neurons in iN/iDA cultures.  

See [`imagingREADME.md`](imaging/imagingREADME.md) for details on workflow steps, input formats, and outputs.



## ðŸ§¬ Lipidomics
Lipidomic profiling of HeLa and dayâ€‘21 iNeurons (Ctrl vs ASAH1â€‘/â€‘) across wholeâ€‘cell and organelleâ€‘IP fractions, with outputs including classâ€‘level barplots, volcano plots, and perâ€‘lipid log2FC tables.



## ðŸ§ª proteomics
Contains Rmd scipts for evaluation of stem-cell derived cortical-like iNeurons and stem-cell derived dopamenergic-like iDA neurons at day 50 of in-vitro differentiation.

- `diff118_iNiDA_d23_CtrlSMPD1ASAH1.Rmd`: TMTpro-based proteomic analysis of day 23 iN and iDA cells across control, SMPD1-/-, and ASAH1-/- conditions.
- `diff132_d50_nDIA.Rmd`: nDIA proteomics of whole-cell iNeurons and iDA neurons at day 50, including organelle-level annotation and HeLa cross-comparison.
- `diff136_iNd35_ctrl_asah1e1_axonalproteome.Rmd`: TMTpro analysis of whole-cell, soma, and axonal fractions in iNeurons with axonal enrichment and RoR modeling.
- `HeLa_Ctrl-ASAH1_LysoIP.Rmd`: Proteomic analysis of isolated lysosomes from HeLa cells comparing control and ASAH1-/- lines, with detailed lysosomal and autophagy annotation.


A detailed README for the scripts can be found in [`readmePROTEOME.md`](proteome/readmePROTEOME.md).



## Requirements
- **R â‰¥ 4.3.0** with: `tidyverse`, `ComplexHeatmap`, `circlize`, `pheatmap`, `ggpubr`, `cowplot`  
- **Python â‰¥ 3.10** with: `cellpose`, `torch`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-image`  


## Usage
- **Proteomics:**  
  Run Rmd scripts in RStudio. Input: processed TMTpro/nDIA data.  
- **Calcium Imaging:**  
  Segment with `run_cellpose_calcium_remoteHDD.py`, then analyze with Rmd pipelines. Input: nd2 files.
